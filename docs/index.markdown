# Steam Content Delivery Network Study

Welcome to our study on Steam's Content Delivery Network and traffic patterns. 
This site serves as a hub for all data, findings, and additional materials 
related to our comprehensive research.

## Overview

Our study delves into the intricate workings of Steam's content delivery 
network, exploring how it manages the increasing demands of modern video 
game distribution. We analyze the evolution of game sizes, particularly 
the shift towards 100GB games, and its impact on distribution networks.

## Key Findings

- Detailed analysis of Steam's data centers and cache locations.
- Investigation into the traffic patterns during game releases and updates.
- Insights into Steam's use of cache servers and third-party CDNs.

## Interactive Graphs

If you're interested in exploring the data we've collected, you can visit our 
Streamlit site [here](https://steamgraphs.streamlit.app/). 
This site provides access to the most up-to-date data available. It features 
the same graphs used in our paper, but with the added flexibility of modifying 
dates, regions, and locations for a customized analysis.

We aim to continuously enhance this site by adding new features, to offer 
deeper insights into the data.
